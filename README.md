# Amazon Alexa NLP project

### Instructions
Follow the next instructions if you would like to download and run the program on your own computer.
1. Installing
• The code and the dataset for this project can be found at my GitHub page github.com/murilogustineli
• The dataset can also be found at kaggle.com/sid321axn/amazon-alexa-reviews 
• If you wish to run the program on your computer, make sure to go to my GitHub page and follow the next steps.

2. Software
For this program, you will need Jupyter Notebook installed on your computer. Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. I recommend installing the Anaconda distribution system; it comes with Jupyter Notebook pre-installed.
• You can install Anaconda following this link https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/

3. Libraries
The Anaconda distribution system comes with many libraries already pre-installed. However, because I will be doing analysis of linguistic patterns, I will be using other libraries that are not included in the Anaconda distribution system. Thus, these libraries need to be installed individually.
Here’s a list of all the libraries that will be used in the program and how to install them. Note that many libraries come already pre-installed with Anaconda.
• NumPy – numpy.org/
o Comes pre-installed with Anaconda

• Pandas – pandas.pydata.org/
o Comes pre-installed with Anaconda

• Matplotlib – matplotlib.org/
o Comes pre-installed with Anaconda

• Seaborn – seaborn.pydata.org/
o Comes pre-installed with Anaconda

• Plotly – plotly.com/install/
o Follow the link and installation guide 

• Scikit-learn – scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html
o Follow the link and installation guide

• Wordcloud – pypi.org/project/wordcloud/
o Follow the link and installation guide

• NLTK – nltk.org/install.html
o Follow the link and installation guide

• spaCy – spacy.io/usage 
o Follow the link and installation guide

Note: make sure you have all of these libraries installed on your computer prior to running the code. If you try running the program without one of the libraries installed, it might give an error.

4. Running the program
Once you installed the Anaconda distributed system and also all of the libraries listed above, open Jupyter Notebook using Anaconda.
• Make sure the database file (amazon_alexa.tsv) and the Jupyter Notebook file (amazon_alexa_NLP.ipynb) are in the same directory. Otherwise, the program will crash due to path issues.

5. Explore the program
After completing all of the steps above, you should be able to run the program on your own computer. If you have any concerns regarding installation or any questions in general, feel free to send me a comment under “Issues” on the project page.
